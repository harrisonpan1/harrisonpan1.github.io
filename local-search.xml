    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week’s market dynamics can be traced along two main threads: <strong>trade negotiations</strong> and <strong>central banks policies</strong>.</p><h1 id="Quick-Take"><a href="#Quick-Take" class="headerlink" title="Quick Take"></a>Quick Take</h1><p><a href="https://www.google.com/finance/">US Stock</a>:</p><ul><li>S&amp;P500        -2.46%</li><li>Nasdaq        -2.57%</li><li>Dow30         -2.75%</li><li>Russell2000   -4.09%</li></ul><p><a href="https://www.google.com/finance/">EU Stock</a>:</p><ul><li>FTSE100       -0.57%</li><li>DAX           -3.27%</li><li>CAC           -3.68%</li></ul><p><a href="https://www.google.com/finance/">Japan Stock</a>:</p><ul><li>NI225         -1.19%</li><li>NK            -2.65%</li></ul><p><a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/">US Bond</a>:</p><ul><li>2yr           3.94% -&gt; 3.70%</li><li>10yr          4.40% -&gt; 4.225%</li></ul><p><a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/">EU Bond</a>:</p><ul><li>UK10yr        4.61% -&gt; 4.53%</li><li>DE10yr        2.73% -&gt; 2.67%</li><li>FR10yr        3.39% -&gt; 3.35%</li></ul><p><a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/">Japan Bond</a>:</p><ul><li>JP10yr        1.60% -&gt; 1.55%</li></ul><p><a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/">Commodity</a>:</p><ul><li>WTI           65.34 -&gt; 67.25</li><li>Gold          3331 -&gt; 3363</li></ul><h1 id="Trade-Negotiations"><a href="#Trade-Negotiations" class="headerlink" title="Trade Negotiations"></a>Trade Negotiations</h1><p>This week saw a series of trade talks involving the US-EU, US-China, and US-South Korea. From the perspective of avoiding an escalation of the trade war, this was positive news.</p><p>However, the market had already priced in these agreements. Instead, attention shifted to the potential impact of the new tariffs on the global economy, leading to cautious sentiment. This is one of the main reasons European stocks fell instead of rising after the deals were announced.</p><p>As the August 1st deadline approached, President Trump signed a new tariff order on July 31st, further heightening market anxiety and putting downward pressure on US stocks.</p><h1 id="Fed-Reserve-and-Economic-Data"><a href="#Fed-Reserve-and-Economic-Data" class="headerlink" title="Fed Reserve and Economic Data"></a>Fed Reserve and Economic Data</h1><p>On Wednesday, the Fed kept interest rates unchanged (as expected), but the Fed Chair downplayed expectations for a September rate cut during the press conference. This hit the stock market and also put downward pressure on bond prices (pushing yields up).</p><p>However, on Friday, both the Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) and PMI data came in weaker than expected. Meanwile, the NFP of May and June were revised down about 90%, way larger than normal. This led the market to believe the Fed would have to restart rate cuts sooner to counter the risk of an economic recession.</p><p>This reversal in expectations ultimately led to US bond yields falling (prices rising). At the same time, concerns about a recession intensified selling pressure on stocks, causing the US market to pull back significantly from its highs.</p><p>This also impact the Europe stock and bond market. Both European bond yields and stocks trended lower on Friday.</p><h1 id="Japanese-Market"><a href="#Japanese-Market" class="headerlink" title="Japanese Market"></a>Japanese Market</h1><p>On Thursday, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) announced that it would not raise interest rates for now and raised its inflation forecast for this year and next.</p><p>Governor Kazuo Ueda’s comments were also conservative. This pushed Japanese government bond yields slightly lower (prices rose slightly). He also mentioned that the current yen Exchange Rates has not deviated significantly from the Bank of Japan’s expectations and will not have a significant impact on the price outlook. This was interpreted by the market as the BoJ tolerating a weaker yen, which triggered a yen sell-off.</p><p>In theory, no rate hike and a weaker yen are positive for Japanese stocks. However, two stronger factors dominated: profit-taking pressure after last week’s major rally and the drag from falling US stocks. Therefore, Japanese stocks ended the week lower.</p><p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> Due to the time difference, the closing price of the Japanese market on Friday did not fully reflect the negative sentiment from the late-day drop in US stocks caused by weak data. If you look at the performance of Nikkei futures, their decline was comparable to that of US and European markets.</p><h1 id="Crude-Oil"><a href="#Crude-Oil" class="headerlink" title="Crude Oil"></a>Crude Oil</h1><p>Prices rose slightly, driven by two factors:</p><ul><li><p>Demand Side: Progress in trade negotiations reduced uncertainty about demand.</p></li><li><p>Supply Side: News that President Trump would advance sanctions on Russian energy exports created supply-side anxiety.</p></li></ul><h1 id="Gold"><a href="#Gold" class="headerlink" title="Gold"></a>Gold</h1><p>Prices increased slightly, mainly influenced by US Treasury yields. Holding gold does not generate interest, so government bond yields represent the opportunity cost of holding gold. Thus, the decline in US Treasury yields this week lowered the opportunity cost of investing in gold, pushing its price higher.</p>]]></content>

    <title>Weekly Global Market Summary 7/27/2025</title>
    <link href="/2025/07/27/summary250727/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week’s market logic is quite clear, though the details can get a bit complex. Let’s break it down.</p><h1 id="Japan-Election-Upset-and-the-Bond-Market-Paradox"><a href="#Japan-Election-Upset-and-the-Bond-Market-Paradox" class="headerlink" title="Japan Election Upset and the Bond Market Paradox"></a>Japan Election Upset and the Bond Market Paradox</h1><p>The week’s biggest story started in Japan. Over the weekend, the ruling coalition led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba suffered a major defeat in the upper house election, losing its majority. This turns the Ishiba cabinet into a minority government, sparking media speculation that the Prime Minister might resign.</p><p>From a market perspective, this created a complex reaction to Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs):</p><ul><li><strong>Pre-Election Jitters:</strong> Markets had already anticipated an imminent opposition victory. Because the opposition parties generally advocate for expansionary fiscal policy, investors grew concerned about Japan’s deficit and the potential for an over-issuance of government bonds. This led to a sell-off in JGBs starting from early this month.</li><li><strong>Post-Election Reversal:</strong> While the ruling coalition lost, the defeat wasn’t as severe as many had feared. This eased concerns about runaway fiscal spending, which in turn reduced the pressure to sell JGBs.</li><li><strong>Political Risk:</strong> At the same time, the prospect of a minority government and a potential prime minister resignation increased political uncertainty. This boosted safe-haven demand, creating buying pressure for JGBs.</li></ul><p>Based on these factors, one would expect JGB prices to rise. So why did they fall (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JP10Y-JP">JP10y 1.532% -&gt; 1.603%</a>)?</p><h1 id="The-Game-Changer-The-US-Japan-Trade-Agreement"><a href="#The-Game-Changer-The-US-Japan-Trade-Agreement" class="headerlink" title="The Game Changer: The US-Japan Trade Agreement"></a>The Game Changer: The US-Japan Trade Agreement</h1><p>The answer lies in the week’s other major news story. On the evening of July 22nd, President Trump announced that the US and Japan had reached a trade agreement. Key terms include a $550 billion investment by Japan in the United States and a reduction of US tariffs on Japanese goods to 15%.</p><p>This news injected a massive dose of optimism into the market:</p><ul><li><strong>Japanese and US Stocks Soared:</strong> Japanese stocks, particularly in the auto sector, surged on the news. This optimism spread to the US, where strong earnings reports (with over 80% of companies beating profit expectations) also helped push the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq to new record highs.</li><li><strong>Safe-Haven Demand Faded:</strong> The positive sentiment caused capital to flow from the safety of bonds into equities. For Japan, the stable trade environment also increased the likelihood that the Bank of Japan could consider restarting interest rate hikes in the future. This created immense downward pressure on Japanese bonds, ultimately overwhelming the upward push from the election results.</li></ul><p>Consequently, JGB yields rose significantly (ie. prices fell).</p><h1 id="US-Treasuries-and-The-Fed"><a href="#US-Treasuries-and-The-Fed" class="headerlink" title="US Treasuries and The Fed"></a>US Treasuries and The Fed</h1><p>On Thursday, President Trump visited the Federal Reserve in Washington, D.C., to review building renovations. He tried to use the $2 billion renovation costs to ramp up political pressure on Chairman Jerome Powell to lower the benchmark interest rate. <a href="https://www.ustreasuryyieldcurve.com/b/gsThlo">This reversed the logic from the previous week, causing the US Treasury yield curve to flatten, as long-term yields fell.</a></p><h1 id="A-Look-at-Europe"><a href="#A-Look-at-Europe" class="headerlink" title="A Look at Europe"></a>A Look at Europe</h1><ul><li><strong>ECB:</strong> The European Central Bank held interest rates steady at 2% on Thursday, pausing its year-long policy easing cycle and adopting a “wait-and-see” approach on future rate cuts. This was in line with expectations and had little market impact.</li><li><strong>Bonds:</strong> Amid the global optimism, German and French bond spreads tightened. In the UK, however, weak retail sales data and the Chancellor’s commitment to fiscal control helped push UK government bonds slightly higher.</li><li><strong>Stocks:</strong> UK stocks rose, driven primarily by corporate earnings. German and French stocks remained largely unchanged as investors await progress on US-EU trade negotiations.</li></ul><h1 id="Dollar-and-Commodities"><a href="#Dollar-and-Commodities" class="headerlink" title="Dollar and Commodities"></a>Dollar and Commodities</h1><ul><li><strong>US Dollar:</strong> Since President Trump’s tariff wars had the effect of strengthening the dollar. A trade agreement, therefore, has the opposite effect. The de-escalation of trade tensions pushed the US dollar lower(<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/%40DX.1?qsearchterm=dollar%20index">-0.79(-0.8%)</a>).</li><li><strong>Gold:</strong> A weaker dollar is typically bullish for gold. However, the dominant force this week was market optimism, which reduces demand for safe-haven assets. As a result, gold finished the week slightly down (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XAU%3D?qsearchterm=xau">-$12.61(-0.38%)</a>).</li><li><strong>Oil:</strong> While market optimism provided a tailwind for oil prices, supply-side news created stronger headwinds. Reports indicated that OPEC+ will decide to continue production at its upcoming meeting, the US eased restrictions on Venezuelan oil, and Chinese economic data raised concerns about future energy demand. The downward pressure from supply ultimately won out, and oil prices fell modestly (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/%40CL.1?qsearchterm=wti%20crude%20">-0.89(-1.35%)</a>).</li></ul>]]></content>
